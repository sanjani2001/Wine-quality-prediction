# Wine Quality Prediction

This is a **Wine Quality Prediction** web application built with **Streamlit**. The app predicts wine quality based on physicochemical features using a machine learning model trained with **scikit-learn**.

## Features

- Upload or input wine features (e.g., acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol).  
- Predict wine quality using a trained **Random Forest / Decision Tree model**.  
- Visualize data with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.  
- User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
